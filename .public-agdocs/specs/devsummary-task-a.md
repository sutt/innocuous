### Script Vars
Utilize these variables below for the task as you read it and process it. The script var will be denoted with $my_script_var when utilized and should be read the value corresponding.

- target_doc: docs/dev-summary.md 
- version_to_update: v0.2.0
- max_summary_chars: 250
- repo_url: github.com/sutt/innocuous

### Steps to Update & Execute this Spec
This section should be ignored by the AI agent; it's for the developer's reference to edit this file for:
Updating:
- Update the variables in script vars
- Run the 3 reference commands and add output to the sections "Command Outputs".
Executing:
- Claude often excels at this task
- Descriptive commit messages are helpful; multiple commit messages with same verbiage can confuse it.

### Command Reference:
These commands you should not run or pay attention to any of these. They are simply are reference for the developer:
> git diff --stat v0.1.0 v0.2.0 -- .public-agdocs/specs
> ls -lt .agdocs/specs/ 
> git log --oneline --no-merges  --not  -n 36

### Task
These are the instructions for your task. Remember to insert the script vars from above when seeing avariable preseeded by $.

Add the updated taskfiles to a markdown table in $target_doc 
for $version_to_update with a row containing:
- just the filename and have it be linked with relative path notation to where it resides in .public-agdocs
- a summary of the files contents (max $max_summary_chars chars)
- add a field that links to a 6-char git sha entry  on the github repo: $repo_url. Do your best guess to find the corresponding commit (available with commit message below). If your guess is too uncertain, or it appears there is no commit for it, place an n/a for this entry.

Rules for the table:
- only include specs/* files for rows
- sort by date order desc (the date information will supplied at the end)
- don't update the rightmost three columns ("diffs" + "notes"). These values will be supplied in a later task.
