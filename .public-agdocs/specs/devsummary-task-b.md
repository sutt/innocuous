### Script Vars
Utilize these variables below for the task as you read it and process it. The script var will be denoted with $my_script_var when utilized and should be read the value corresponding.

- target_doc: docs/dev-summary.md 
- version_to_update: v0.2.0
- diffs_main_directory: stego_llm
- diffs_on_other_directories: tests

### Steps to Update & Execute this Spec
This section should be ignored by the AI agent; it's for the developer's reference to edit this file for:
Updating:
- Update the variables in script vars:
    - the diffs vars are helpful for different repo setups
Executing:
- Claude excels at this task.
- Enable the `Bash(git:*)` permissions for the claude agent.

### Task
These are the instructions for your task. Remember to insert the script vars from above when seeing a variable preseeded by $.
update the table in $target_doc:
- update the table for $version_to_update
- add values for all (or some of) the "code changes" / "diffs" columns:
    - use the column name to understand which slices of the codebase should be considered for the diffs.
    - these code diffs should only apply to the particular git commit referenced in that row of the table (it should not be the total diffs over the whole version)
    - for the first diff column, use the diffs from within directory $diff_main_directory
    - for the second diff column, use the the diffs from within directory $diff_on_other_directories
- each value should be represented as "+A/-D" where A is the number of additions and -D is deletion or modifications from a git diff / git diff --stat,
    - e.g. "+23/-12", or "+5/-0"

Use git commands to investigate these commit shas and run git diffs that will allows you to fill in the full table.

Rules used to build the table previously:
- only include specs/* files for rows
- sort by date order desc (the date information will supplied at the end)

Reference for commit sha's in the table
