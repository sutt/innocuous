The king sat in his golden chair,
A scepter in his hand,
A queen stood next by his side,
Her beauty shone far and wide,
And all around their castle stoodThe noblemen whose lives did hinge
Awaiting his decrees of war Or peace that day with hope did sing
What word shall end this royal verse
And grant my pen its rightful due
